## HLA xAPI Adapter Federate

An HLA federate capable of converting HLA RTI events (interactions and object updates) into xAPI Statements and storing them in a Learning Record Store.

### Configuration

The Federate uses multiple sources of configuration including a Simulation.config file and a json config file for configuring resulting xAPI.

#### Simulation Config

To connect to an HLA Federation, you will want to update the `Simulation.config` files (or `Simulation.pitch.config` if running in pitch mode). You will update the following fields to reflect the Federation details and also point to the appropriate FOM:

```
localSettingsDesignator=
federationName=HlaFedereplSimulation
federateName=xAPI Adapter HLA Federate

fom=config/HlaFedereplFOM.xml
```

#### xAPI Config

The sample `xapi-config.json` reflects the current state of compatible configuration options.
See the [HLA xAPI Adapter xAPI Configuration Reference](doc/xapi-config.md) for a full configuration reference.

### Vendoring Portico

`make lib` rebuilds and vendors only Portico's Java jar into this repository's local Maven file repository. Portico ships its own Ant wrapper at `codebase/ant`, so no separate Ant installation is required.

The vendoring script intentionally uses a Java-only Portico Ant build file. On Linux, Portico's full `build.xml` imports C++ profiles that are not needed for this project and can fail during Ant parsing with a duplicate `cpp.hla13.compile` target before any Java compilation begins.

### To Run

The build output does not bundle an RTI implementation. The development runtime targets add either the vendored Portico RTI jar or a local Pitch RTI install on the runtime classpath.

You will need to update `config/Simulation.config` with the appropriate federate information, and `config/fom.xml` (or a new FOM referenced from `Simulation.config`) with the federate's appropriate FOM. The current config should work with the HlaStarterKit Project from Pitch.

To build and run federate once configured:

```shell
make clean build
make run-rti # if you would like to run a Portico RTI, do this and then open a new terminal for the next line
make run-dev
```

To run against a Pitch RTI installation instead of Portico:

```shell
make clean build
make run-dev-pitch PITCH_RTI_LIB="/path/to/prti1516e/lib/*"
```

### Development Checks

Use Maven's `verify` lifecycle before opening a PR:

```shell
make verify
```

This runs unit tests, builds the package, and fails if linting or formatting checks do not pass. Note that the tests require docker to run.

The PostgreSQL object-cache contract tests use Testcontainers and require a working Docker-compatible container
runtime. The test suite starts and removes its own PostgreSQL 17 container; no manually configured database is
needed.

To run only linting locally:

```shell
make lint
```

To update formatting locally:

```shell
make format
```

Project style is intentionally minimal: Java uses 4-space indentation, no wildcard imports, braces on control
statements, UTF-8 text, LF line endings, final newlines, and no trailing whitespace. Make recipes keep required tab
indentation.
